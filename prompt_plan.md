Below is a detailed blueprint, followed by iterative breakdowns that refine the plan further, and concluding with a series of prompts (in code blocks) that can be fed into a code-generation LLM. Each prompt is designed to implement a chunk of functionality in a test-driven manner, building on previous steps.

---

## 1. High-Level Project Blueprint

1. **Set Up the Environment**
   - Initialize a Next.js project.
   - Install Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS, React Testing Library, Jest, Cypress, and any other necessary tools.
   - Configure project paths, scripts, and basic project metadata.

2. **Create the Core Layout and Navigation**
   - Implement a layout that includes a sidebar and top-level navigation.
   - Ensure Shadcn UI components are correctly styled with Tailwind CSS.
   - Provide placeholder pages for:
     - Sports Schedule
     - Movies
     - TV Series
     - Partner Settings
   - Set up Next.js routing between pages.

3. **Configure Data Fetching**
   - Connect to the JSON feeds (matches, movies, series).
   - Implement a server-side or client-side fetch strategy (Next.js getServerSideProps or getStaticProps, or a custom approach).
   - Store and cache the fetched data for quick lookups.

4. **Implement Sports Schedule Page**
   - Display a table or grid of upcoming events.
   - Provide a date-time filter bar and any necessary search functionality (sport, league, team, etc.).
   - Verify data is loading correctly from the JSON feed.

5. **Implement Movies and TV Series Pages**
   - Display lists of available movies and TV series.
   - Include search and sort by release year, popularity, etc.
   - Reuse the shared filter bar or create dedicated filters if needed.

6. **Create Link Generation and Customization Logic**
   - Define a function or service to build affiliate links (league URL, match URL, network URL).
   - Inject Impact Radius ID, sharedid, subId1, subId2, etc.
   - Make sure these parameters can be toggled in a partner settings context.

7. **Set Up the Cart (Add to Cart and Bulk Export)**
   - Allow users to select up to 5 events.
   - Store selected events in a global state or React context.
   - Provide an interface to review and remove items.
   - Implement CSV export or copy-to-clipboard functionality.

8. **Build the Partner Settings Page**
   - Provide form fields for Impact Radius ID and preferred link type.
   - Persist these settings in session (in-memory or basic database for MVP).
   - Offer a reset-to-default option.

9. **Testing (TDD/Integration)**
   - Write unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library for components (buttons, forms, etc.).
   - Write integration tests to confirm user flows (adding items to cart, generating links).
   - Write end-to-end tests with Cypress to simulate real user interactions.

10. **Deployment and Hosting**
    - Deploy the MVP to Vercel or Netlify.
    - Configure domain as needed for local development to pass the dev-api.fubo.tv CORS restriction.
    - Ensure caching and performance best practices are followed.

---

## 3. Iterative Breakdown (Second Pass)

We refine each phase into smaller sub-steps. The goal is to ensure manageable chunks for development and testing.

### Phase 1: Initial Project Setup
1. Create a new Next.js app (using `npx create-next-app` or similar).
2. Install and configure Shadcn UI according to documentation.
3. Install and configure Tailwind CSS.
4. Set up Jest and React Testing Library (for unit tests).
5. Set up Cypress (for end-to-end tests).
6. Commit and verify that everything runs and tests are operational.

### Phase 2: Core Layout and Navigation
1. Create a main Layout component with a sidebar (using Shadcn UI components).
2. Configure Next.js routing for pages (Sports, Movies, TV Series, Partner Settings).
3. Add a minimal test to check if the sidebar renders and each nav link is present.
4. Commit changes and run tests.

### Phase 3: Sports Schedule Page
1. Create a page for sports schedule (for example, `/sports-schedule`).
2. Implement data fetching from the matches JSON feed.
3. Render the data in a basic table or card grid.
4. Add a simple date/time filter. 
5. Write tests to confirm data is displayed and filtering works.

### Phase 4: Movies and TV Series Pages
1. Create a page for movies and a page for TV series.
2. Fetch relevant JSON data for each.
3. Render listings, allowing search/sort options.
4. Write tests to confirm data is shown and search/sort features work.

### Phase 5: Link Generation Service
1. Create a utility or service function for building affiliate links.
2. Handle parameters (irmp, sharedid, subId1, etc.) based on a config.
3. Write unit tests to confirm correct parameter concatenation.
4. Integrate the link builder into the sports schedule page (for example, a "Generate Link" button for each event).

### Phase 6: Cart Functionality
1. Implement a global or top-level state management (could be a small Redux store or React Context) for selected events.
2. Add an "Add to Cart" button to each event.
3. Limit selection to 5. 
4. Create a cart overview component, with export options (CSV or clipboard).
5. Write tests for adding/removing items, limiting to 5, and successful exports.

### Phase 7: Partner Settings
1. Create a settings page (route: `/partner-settings`).
2. Include fields for Impact Radius ID, link type preference, subIds.
3. Integrate these settings into the link generation service (overriding defaults).
4. Write tests ensuring user settings are saved and used correctly.

### Phase 8: Final Testing and Integration
1. Consolidate all tests (unit, integration).
2. Write end-to-end tests with Cypress covering common user flows.
3. Verify everything is integrated: links are generated with the correct parameters, cart works, pages are fully navigable.
4. Prepare for deployment (configure domain, set environment variables).
5. Deploy to Vercel or Netlify.

---

## 4. Iterative Breakdown (Third Pass)

Each step can be subdivided further to minimize risk and ensure thorough testing. Here is an example of how Phase 3 (Sports Schedule Page) might break down even further:

1. **Create sports-schedule page**: 
   - Scaffold the new page component.
   - Write a test that ensures the page mounts.

2. **Fetch matches data**:
   - Implement a function to fetch matches data from the JSON feed.
   - Test this function in isolation (mock the fetch and check the response).

3. **Display matches**:
   - Render a list or table of the fetched data.
   - Add a test checking if the correct number of rows or items is shown.

4. **Date/time filter**:
   - Add the filtering mechanism to the UI.
   - Write a test to confirm that filtering reduces the displayed matches appropriately.

This level of detail provides enough granularity to implement and test each feature safely while still making meaningful progress.

## 5. Final: Test-Driven Code-Generation Prompts

Below is a sample series of prompts you can feed into a code-generation LLM. Each prompt assumes the code-generation model continues from the previous context. If your LLM does not support continuous context, you can copy the resulting code back in at each step.

Remember: these prompts are just a sample structure, and you can tailor them as needed. Each is enclosed in triple backticks as requested.

---

### Prompt 1: Initial Project Setup
```text
You are a code-generation assistant. We are building an MVP with Next.js, Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS, and a TDD approach. Our first task: set up the project. Please:

1. Initialize a Next.js project (you can use a command like npx create-next-app).
2. Install and configure Shadcn UI, referencing the official documentation.
3. Install and configure Tailwind CSS.
4. Add Jest and React Testing Library for unit tests, plus sample test config.
5. Add Cypress for end-to-end tests.

Write all needed configuration files (tailwind.config.js, jest.config.js, cypress.config.js). Ensure everything is ready to run tests out of the box. Create a simple README with setup instructions and a "test" script that runs the unit tests. Then show the final file structure and relevant code. Do not write code that is outside the scope of this setup task.
```

---

### Prompt 2: Core Layout and Navigation
```text
We now have a functional Next.js app with Shadcn UI, Tailwind, Jest, and Cypress. Our next step is to create a core layout with a sidebar and top navigation using Shadcn UI. We want:

1. A Layout component in a file named Layout.tsx that wraps all pages.
2. A sidebar with placeholders for links to:
   - Sports Schedule
   - Movies
   - TV Series
   - Partner Settings
3. Routes for these pages (just placeholders for now).
4. A minimal Jest test ensuring the sidebar renders with the correct links.

Write the necessary code for the layout, the pages, and the test. Use Shadcn UI components for the layout styling. End with instructions to run the test and confirm it passes.
```

---

### Prompt 3: Sports Schedule Page (Basic)
```text
We have the layout and placeholder pages. Now let's build the Sports Schedule page using a TDD approach:

1. Create a sports-schedule page in pages/sports-schedule/index.tsx (or a similar path).
2. Implement a function to fetch matches data from a JSON feed (use a mock URL or placeholder in the code).
3. Write a unit test for the fetch function using Jest (mocking fetch or axios).
4. Render the data in a simple table or list on the page.
5. Write an integration test with React Testing Library verifying the table displays data correctly.

Assume the JSON data has fields like matchId, homeTeam, awayTeam, date, time, league. Show how you would test it, including a sample mock response.
```

---

### Prompt 4: Sports Schedule Page (Filtering)
```text
Next, we will add date/time filtering to the Sports Schedule page. We use TDD, so please:

1. Write a test that verifies filtering by date/time reduces the displayed events.
2. Implement a basic filter bar with a date and time picker (or text field for now).
3. Update the table rendering logic to filter out events that do not match the selected date/time.
4. Confirm the test passes after implementation.

Include relevant code for the UI, the filtering logic, and the test. Keep it minimal and functional.
```

---

### Prompt 5: Movies and TV Series Pages
```text
Now let's build pages for Movies and TV Series. We'll continue to use TDD:

1. Create two new pages: /movies and /tv-series.
2. Implement fetch functions to retrieve movie and series data from JSON feeds (again mock feeds or placeholders).
3. Add searching or sorting capabilities (for example, sort by release year, search by title).
4. Write tests that verify:
   - Data is fetched correctly.
   - Search and sort functionalities work.
5. Make sure both pages fit into our existing layout.

Provide the code for pages, fetch logic, and tests.
```

---

### Prompt 6: Link Generation Service
```text
We now have three main pages: Sports, Movies, and TV Series. Let's implement an affiliate link generation service. We will use TDD, so:

1. Create a utility function buildAffiliateLink in a file named affiliateLinkService.ts.
2. This function should accept parameters for link type (league, match, network), partner ID, subIds, and optional utm parameters.
3. Return a properly formatted URL string that includes these parameters.
4. Write Jest unit tests covering various combinations of parameters.

After writing the tests, implement buildAffiliateLink so the tests pass. Provide the final code for the service and the test file.
```

---

### Prompt 7: Cart Functionality
```text
Time to add cart functionality. We will let users select up to 5 events and then export those links in bulk. Steps:

1. Create a React Context or Redux slice named CartContext or CartSlice.
2. Write tests that confirm:
   - Adding items to the cart is possible.
   - Attempting to add more than 5 items is disallowed.
   - Removing items updates the cart.
3. Implement a simple UI component (CartButton) that shows the count of selected items and opens a cart modal.
4. Enable bulk export. For now, just display a console.log or text output of the link URLs. We will finalize CSV or clipboard next.
5. Confirm tests pass.

Provide code for the context, the cart UI component, and relevant tests.
```

---

### Prompt 8: Export to CSV and Copy-to-Clipboard
```text
Let's enhance the cart's export functionality. Please:

1. Write a test confirming that clicking "Export CSV" generates a CSV string with the selected items' links.
2. Write a test confirming that clicking "Copy to Clipboard" copies the links to the clipboard.
3. Implement the logic in the cart UI, ensuring we only export exactly what is in the cart (up to 5).
4. Show the final code and confirm tests pass.

Keep the design minimal but ensure it's functional. Remember to use the buildAffiliateLink service to form the URLs in the export.
```

---

### Prompt 9: Partner Settings Page
```text
We will now add a Partner Settings page, letting users configure their Impact Radius ID, link type, subIds, etc. The steps:

1. Write a test that checks if the Partner Settings page loads and accepts user input.
2. Create the page with form fields for:
   - Impact Radius ID
   - Default link type
   - SubIds (optional)
3. Integrate these settings so that the link generation service uses them if available.
4. Verify in the tests that saving settings updates the link generation parameters.
5. Provide final code for the page, any associated context or store, and the updated tests.
```

---

### Prompt 10: Final Testing and Integration
```text
Finally, let's tie it all together and prepare for deployment:

1. Write end-to-end tests with Cypress verifying:
   - Navigation to Sports, Movies, and TV Series pages.
   - Adding events to the cart and exporting.
   - Modifying Partner Settings.
2. Ensure no major errors appear in the console.
3. Provide instructions for deploying to Vercel or Netlify.
4. Confirm final folder structure and that all tests pass.

Please provide the final environment files, instructions, and any relevant code changes. The goal is a deployable MVP.
```

### Usage Notes

- Each prompt explicitly builds on the code and context from the previous prompt.
- In an actual code-generation session, you would paste the output from each step back into the model prompt or rely on the model's memory if supported.
- You can further refine or adjust these prompts to match your project's actual data structure, naming conventions, or testing preferences.

This series of prompts ensures a test-driven, incremental approach. No code is left orphaned, and each step builds on the prior one. By the end, you'll have a functional MVP with robust test coverage and best practices.
