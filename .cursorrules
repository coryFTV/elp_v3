# Memory Management
- Start with "Remembering..." and read what you stored in memory before working on a task
- Reference knowledge as "memory"
- When the assigned task is done:
  1. Create/update entities
  2. Define relationships
  3. Store observations

# Entity Types
1. `Component` - UI components, reusable modules, etc.
2. `Architecture` - Design patterns, system structures, data flow
3. `Feature` - Project features and functionality
4. `Bug` - Issues encountered and their solutions
5. `Performance` - Performance considerations and optimizations
6. `APIUsage` - Framework implementations, third-party integrations
7. `ProjectStructure` - File organization, module dependencies

# Relation Types
1. `implements` - Shows how components implement specific patterns
2. `depends_on` - Captures dependencies between components
3. `optimizes` - Links performance improvements to components
4. `causes` - Connects issues to their source
5. `resolves` - Links solutions to specific problems
6. `relates_to` - Generic relationship for connected concepts
7. `improves` - Shows how new patterns enhance existing components
8. `conflicts_with` - Identifies incompatibilities or conflicts
